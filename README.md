# SynthScoreNet
## Overview
SynthScoreNet is a project that utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic credit data for individuals with limited or no credit history, and predicts custom credit scores based on this data using machine learning models. This project aims to improve the accuracy and inclusivity of the credit assessment process.

## Features
Firstly, the project involves loading and preprocessing real credit data, which might require dealing with missing values, categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Secondly, the project uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic credit data. GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator generates synthetic data, and the discriminator evaluates whether the data is real or synthetic. The goal is to train the generator to produce synthetic data that is indistinguishable from real data, and the discriminator to correctly classify real and synthetic data.

Thirdly, the project involves training a regression model on the synthetic credit data to predict custom credit scores. This might involve selecting an appropriate regression algorithm, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and evaluating the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared.

Fourthly, the project requires predicting custom credit scores for individuals with limited or no credit history. This might involve gathering data on other relevant factors that could impact creditworthiness, such as income, age, and demographic information.

Finally, the project involves putting all the pieces together and testing the model's ability to predict custom credit scores accurately. This might involve adjusting the hyperparameters of the GAN and regression models, selecting appropriate loss functions and optimization algorithms, and testing the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

## Getting Started
To get started with the SynthScoreNet project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone 
https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/SynthScoreNet.git.
2. Install the required libraries and dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Load and preprocess the real credit data in the real_credit_data.csv file.
4. Define the generator and discriminator models for the GAN in the gan.py file.
5. Train the GAN on the real credit data to generate synthetic credit data, and save the generator model.
6. Train a machine learning model on the synthetic credit data to predict custom credit scores, and save the model.
7. Use the saved models to predict custom credit scores for individuals with limited or no credit history.
