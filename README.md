# SynthScoreNet
## Overview
SynthScoreNet is a project that utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic credit data for individuals with limited or no credit history, and predicts custom credit scores based on this data using machine learning models. This project aims to improve the accuracy and inclusivity of the credit assessment process.

## Features
Generates synthetic credit data using GANs
Predicts custom credit scores using machine learning models
Improves accuracy and inclusivity of the credit assessment process

## Getting Started
To get started with the SynthScoreNet project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone 
https://github.com/vaddhiparthy/SynthScoreNet.git.
2. Install the required libraries and dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Load and preprocess the real credit data in the real_credit_data.csv file.
4. Define the generator and discriminator models for the GAN in the gan.py file.
5. Train the GAN on the real credit data to generate synthetic credit data, and save the generator model.
6. Train a machine learning model on the synthetic credit data to predict custom credit scores, and save the model.
7. Use the saved models to predict custom credit scores for individuals with limited or no credit history.

## Dependencies
Python 3.6 or higher
